Biometric Proprioception Analysis System (Sensor Fusion)

Project Overview
A biomechanical data acquisition system designed to measure proprioception and balance. It uses an Arduino Nano and an MMA7361 accelerometer mounted on an unstable platform to extract stability metrics.

Technical ImplementationSignal Extraction (OT): 
1- Real-time sampling of tri-axial acceleration data.
2- Data Pipeline: Python-based ingestion layer for continuous logging and validation of physical stability metrics.

Methodology: AI-Assisted Prototyping
Developed using an Iterative AI Orchestration approach. I provided LLMs with physical engineering constraints to optimize sensor calibration and sampling frequency, reaching a functional solution through $n$ iterations of feedback.
